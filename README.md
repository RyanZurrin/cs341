# CS341 Lab
Here you'll find all the starter codes for CS341 lab. Instructions for the lab are posted on <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/~cheungr/cs341/"> Professor Cheung's Website </a>. 

We will be using <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com"> TinkerCad </a> for digital labs. Instructions for setup and lab 1 will be coming shortly.

**Please Note:** we are no longer going to be UnoArduSim this semester. My apologies to anyone who has already downloaded the environment.
