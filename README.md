# CS341 Lab
Here you'll find all the starter codes for CS341 lab. Instructions for the lab are also posted on <a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/~cheungr/cs341/"> Professor Cheung's Website </a>.
Policies can be found in the powerpoint for Lab 1.

We will be using <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com"> TinkerCad </a> for digital labs. Instructions and starter codes will come out periodically.

**Please Note:** we are no longer going to be UnoArduSim this semester. My apologies to anyone who has already downloaded the environment.
